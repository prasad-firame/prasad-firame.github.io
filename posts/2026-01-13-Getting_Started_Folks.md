# Getting Started: My Learning Journey

Hello! 👋  
I’m Neoox, and I’ve decided to share my learning journey in **engineering**

This blog is my personal space to document what I learn, experiment with, and build — so I can **look back** and also help others who are starting out.

## Why I Started

Learning technology is fun, but **without documenting**, it’s easy to forget or lose track.  
Here’s why I’m starting this blog:

1. To consolidate what I learn  
2. To share practical tips with others  
3. To create a portfolio of my progress

## How I Plan to Document

Each blog post will cover:

- A **topic I learned**  
- **Step-by-step explanation** or example  
- **Tips/tricks** or common mistakes  
- **Resources** I found useful

Stay tuned!
