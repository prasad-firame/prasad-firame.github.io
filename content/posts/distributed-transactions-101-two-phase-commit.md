# Introduction

In distributed systems and modern databases, maintaining **data consistency** is critical. This post introduces the concept of **transactions**, explains **ACID properties**, and dives into the **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol** to ensure reliable distributed transactions.

## What is a Transaction?

A transaction is a **sequence of operations** performed as a single unit of work. Transactions are designed to be **atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID)**:

- **Atomic**: All operations succeed or none.  
- **Consistent**: Database moves from one valid state to another.  
- **Isolated**: Concurrent transactions don’t interfere.  
- **Durable**: Changes are permanent once committed.

## Challenges in Distributed Systems

- Multiple databases or nodes can be involved.  
- Partial failures can leave the system in an inconsistent state.  
- Simple commit/rollback is not enough when operations span multiple systems.

## Two-Phase Commit (2PC)

The **Two-Phase Commit protocol** solves these problems by coordinating distributed transactions in **two phases**:

1. **Prepare Phase**:  
   - The coordinator asks all participants if they are ready to commit.  
   - Each participant responds with `Yes` (ready) or `No` (abort).

2. **Commit Phase**:  
   - If all participants said `Yes`, the coordinator sends a **commit command**.  
   - If any participant said `No`, the coordinator sends an **abort command**.

## Example Workflow

```text
Coordinator -> Participant1: Prepare
Coordinator -> Participant2: Prepare
Participant1 -> Coordinator: Yes
Participant2 -> Coordinator: Yes
Coordinator -> Participant1: Commit
Coordinator -> Participant2: Commit
